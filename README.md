What is?


OOP (Object Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm in which data is encapsulated in objects, which have their own behavior.



## Key Concepts



- Classes: Templates or molds for creating objects. They define common properties and behaviors.
- Objects: Instances of a class, with specific data that conform to the properties defined in the class.
- Encapsulation: Hiding the internal details of an object. Only certain methods are exposed to interact with its data.
- Inheritance: Mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class, promoting code reuse.
- Polymorphism: Ability of an object to take various forms, allowing different classes to have methods with the same name but with different implementations.
- Abstraction: Process of simplifying the complex system, hiding the internal implementation and showing only what is necessary.
